In Apple Notes, it's easy to put stuff in, but impossible to get stuff out. You write a note, it goes into a black-hole, never to be read again. Their search sucks. You can scroll down a few years, but it's slow.

Drift transforms your Apple Notes experience with intelligent AI indexing that makes your notes discoverable and actionable.
