Being born poor in a poor country, then becoming rich enough to get your family out of poverty and collecting enough resources to be able to live without a job, is in my eyes the most impressive thing I have done.

Here is my story in detail

- In 5th grade, I wrote a district-level exam and got selected to study at the JNV in my district. JNV is a special school system where you get great quality all-round education, totally free from 6th to 12th grade. They only admit students for 6th grade—only 40 students per batch in those days.

- We did not have teachers for Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics in 10th grade. We all self-studied. I got 10/10 in Mathematics and 9/10 in Science.

- We did not have teachers for Mathematics and Physics in 12th grade either. We all had to self-study. I got 85/100 in Mathematics and 80/100 in Physics.

- The real result that matters in 12th grade is how well you do on the exam for admission to IITs and NITs. There is a huge industry for coaching these tests; the curriculum is tougher than 12th grade. I have not met anyone who cleared these exams without expensive coaching. Sure, some folks do it, but I haven't met any.

    By self-studying, I got college seats to study engineering at both an IIT and an NIT. I wasn't happy with the stream I got, so I studied more and took those exams again the next year, and again got seats at an IIT and an NIT. My NIT seat was really good, so I got admitted.

    Taking these exams again was an irrational risk that one can only take with extreme self-belief. While I was preparing for these exams again, I was already admitted to a college. I had to sacrifice my grades in that college heavily. Doing poorly in these exams would have meant I had to continue studying at the same college (far worse than my NIT in reputation), with pathetic first-year grades. I was also risking the loan my dad had taken.

- I mostly did experiments, built websites, started a college magazine, made short films, wrote some short stories, tried to write novels, and did painting. I thought grades didn't matter—all that mattered was your talent. I thought I was going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg. Turns out grades mattered a lot when you wanted a job out of college. Getting better grades involved a haggling process with temporary and underqualified tutors. I scored 5.4/10 overall. I was second to last in my class of 106.

- I was good at writing software. Someone gave me a small job. I had to struggle with low pay for about a year. I found open source as a great tool to prove yourself, and I used it. After that, I probably had the best job in my batch, both by pay and quality of work. I was the only software engineer in India for a USV-funded, YC company, with a $300M+ ICO (Filecoin).

- At this point, I have some 7-8 years' worth of open source contributions to some amazing projects. I feel like I have enjoyed a good career in software so far.
